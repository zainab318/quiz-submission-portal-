## 🤖 CrewAI Implementation

The application uses a CrewAI-inspired agent system with specialized roles:

### Quiz Generation Agents

1. **Question Generator Agent**
   - Role: Creates high-quality educational questions
   - Specializes in generating appropriate difficulty levels
   - Ensures comprehensive topic coverage

2. **Quiz Reviewer Agent**
   - Role: Reviews and improves question quality
   - Checks for accuracy and educational value
   - Ensures clear explanations and balanced content

### Agent Workflow

```javascript
// Example of how agents work together
const quiz = await quizCrew.generateQuiz('mathematics', 'medium', 10);
// 1. Question Generator creates initial questions
// 2. Reviewer Agent improves and validates questions
// 3. Final quiz is returned with quality assurance
```
